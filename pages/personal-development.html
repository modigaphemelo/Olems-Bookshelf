                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Wade's prison-honed calisthenics bible touts survival strength, yet its macho myths and risky progressions invite injury's specter, a gritty saga that delves: true conditioning builds resilience, not recklessness, lest the quest for power imprison the body in pain. 3/10.</p>
